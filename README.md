Hello I am **Rayyan**, ***I Made This Calculator In Python***<br> 
**Note** : ***This Project was developed on _windows 10_ completely and I would recommend to run this on _windows 10_ as there are chances of errors on switching the operating system.***<br>
##  Basic Calculator
This Project Is Just A Basic Calculator Not A scientific Calculator and I Tried My Best To Make This Calculator User Friendly As Possible<br>
Any One Can Make This Calculator Becuase This Is Made By A Beginner<br>
**If You Want To Make Any Project In Any Language And Get Error Google It And Find It<br>
Becuase I Google It Asked My Tech Professional Friends**
