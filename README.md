Hello I am Rayyan, I Made This Calculator In Python<br> 
**Note** : This Project was developed on _windows 10_ completely and I would recommend to run this on _windows 10_ as there are chances of errors on switching the operating system.<br>

This Project currently has more than 50 if statements and each one is used to fix the common errors that may occur during the execution of the program.Instead of adding new features my main aim was to remove existing errors and to make the project error free and user friendly as possible.

Special Thanks : [**Crossroads Team**.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoGHeFY7jE2OB_TJS_87MOA)
